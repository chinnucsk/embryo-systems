TODO List
---------

* Finding a better record or structure. The 'remodel' branch was there to simplify but in the end it's did the reverse (at least at the code level).
* make a difference between 'store' and 'restore' in the storage server
* find a new way to have different backends for the storage server
* implements a couchdb backend
